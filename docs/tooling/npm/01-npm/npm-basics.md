# Node and Npm (node package manager)

Install node with npm from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

## Node

`Node` is based on `javascript`. But has differences. The main difference is you can execute it outside a browser, unlike javascript does. You can execute `node` from the command line.

You will need `node` to create `react` applications. 

## Npm: node package manager

`npm` is the utility to manage the libraries or dependencies on a `node` project. For instance, if you create a `react` project, you can use `npm` to install the `react` packages and more dependencies.

`npx` is a utility to run `npm` like a `.exe` windows file.

## Create the project from scratch

Follow the instructions here:

Once you have installed `node` and `npm`, execute this command and follow the steps.

```bash
npx create-react-app your-project-name
```
